# TF-B1 - Stratospheric Balloon Experimental Platform

![Example of experimental gondola](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ODZ-UJF-AV-CR/FIK-6/refs/heads/FIK-6/doc/img/FIK-6_gondola_weight.jpg)

The [TF-B1](https://github.com/ThunderFly-aerospace/TF-B1) stratospheric balloon is a versatile high-altitude experimental platform designed for several-hour flights to altitudes around 30 km. It serves as a universal carrier for atmospheric research, technology validation, and educational projects. Built on proven ThunderFly avionics modules, TF-B1 provides reliable performance in near-space conditions, offering a cost-effective alternative to satellite testbeds.

## Main design highlights

* Ready-to-use integration with [TF-ATMON atmospheric monitoring system](/instruments/TF-ATMON)
* Redundant telemetry link via [TFSIK01 communication system](/avionics/TFSIK01)
  * Backup by LoRa, using [TFLORA01 modem](/avionics/TFLORA01)
* Onboard positioning and timing with [TFGPS01](/avionics/TFGPS01)
* Gondola orientation tracking
* Atmospheric sensing with [TFHT01](/avionics/TFHT01) or [TFHT02](/avionics/TFHT02)
  * Number of sensors is higly expandable by use of [TFI2CADT01](/avionics/TFI2CADT01)
* Reliable power distribution using [TFSBEC01 power module](/avionics/TFSBEC01)
  * Designed for relatively high-power payloads up to tens of Watts
* Support for scientific instruments with [TFUNIPAYLOAD01 payload interface](/avionics/TFUNIPAYLOAD01)
* Continuous pre-flight charging and power monitoring for maximal uptime
  * Ground monitoring direcly by [TFUSBSERIAL01](/avionics/TFUSBSERIAL01)

## Applications

### Atmospheric research

TF-B1 enables high-resolution measurements of temperature, humidity, and gas composition in the stratosphere. Using ThunderFlyâ€™s [TFHT01](/avionics/TFHT01) and [TFHT02](/avionics/TFHT02) sensors, vertical atmospheric profiles can be collected for improved weather prediction models and climate studies.

### Aerospace and materials testing

The balloon gondola provides near-space conditions such as isolated environment, extreme temperatures, and increased radiation. This environment is ideal for testing spacecraft components, electronics, and materials before deployment in orbit.

### Educational and outreach missions

TF-B1 offers an accessible way for students and researchers to conduct real high-altitude experiments. Short-duration flights allow hands-on experience in instrumentation, avionics, and atmospheric sciences.

## Reference flights

TF-B1 has been successfully deployed in multiple missions, proving its reliability and flexibility:

* [FIK-9 experiment](https://github.com/ODZ-UJF-AV-CR/FIK-9)
* [FIK-6 high-altitude balloon flight](https://github.com/ODZ-UJF-AV-CR/FIK-6)
* [FIK-5 experiment](https://github.com/ODZ-UJF-AV-CR/FIK-5)

## Professional support

Professional support for the ThunderFly TF-B1 stratospheric balloon platform is commercially available from [ThunderFly s.r.o.](https://www.thunderfly.cz/). For inquiries, contact us at **[info@thunderfly.cz](mailto:info@thunderfly.cz)**.
