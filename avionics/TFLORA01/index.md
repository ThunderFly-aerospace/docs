# TFLORA01 - UAV LoRa and FSK Transceiver

The TFLORA01 device is designed for long-range telemetry transmission from UAVs using LoRa technology. It operates in the sub-GHz frequency band and is based on the Semtech SX1262 transceiver, which supports LoRa and (G)FSK modulation for various telemetry and IoT applications.

This module does not contain any onboard firmware, providing greater flexibility for custom implementations. Firmware for communication protocols such as MAVLink is provided by out-of-tree driver in the PX4 autopilot system. The absence of firmware in the transceiver module allows for enhanced versatility, such as the ability to send standard MAVLink telemetry streams while occasionally transmitting LoRa packets to a LoRaWAN IoT network.

For detailed usage instructions or custom integration, please contact **[ThunderFly](https://www.thunderfly.cz/contact-us.html)**.

## Usage

The module is intended to be connected by SPI to the flight controller (FC), with the FC's firmware handling MAVLink telemetry streams. The custom-formatted packets can be transmitted to LoRaWAN networks, enhancing UAV-to-IoT capabilities. This multi-modulation use case is ideal for integrating UAV operations with broader IoT infrastructure.

Currently, support connection to LoRaWAN networks is implemented in PX4. This allows the device to transmit telemetry or other data to IoT services such as The Things Network.

The next step on the development roadmap is the implementation of support for [mLRS](https://github.com/olliw42/mLRS). This system enables flexible and long-range telemetry communication beyond conventional LoRaWAN capabilities and offers combined RC-like control.

Another planned feature is the implementation of a driver to enable compatibility with the [SiK firmware](https://github.com/ThunderFly-aerospace/SiK) and packet format. This would allow the TFLORA01 module to integrate with existing radio communication setups using the SiK protocol.

## Integration with PX4

The TFLORA01 module is compatible with PX4, which manages the primary MAVLink telemetry transmissions. As the module does not include any pre-programmed firmware, users have the flexibility to implement additional features, such as periodic LoRaWAN packet transmission alongside standard telemetry streams.
