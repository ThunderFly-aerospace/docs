# TFLORA01 - UAV LoRa and FSK Transceiver

The TFLORA01 device is designed for long-range telemetry transmission from UAVs using LoRa technology. It operates in the sub-GHz frequency band and is based on the Semtech SX1262 transceiver, which supports LoRa and (G)FSK modulation for various telemetry and IoT applications.

This module does not contain any onboard firmware, providing greater flexibility for custom implementations. Firmware for communication protocols such as MAVLink is provided by out-of-tree driver in the PX4 autopilot system. The absence of firmware in the transceiver module allows for enhanced versatility, such as the ability to send standard MAVLink telemetry streams while occasionally transmitting LoRa packets to a LoRaWAN IoT network.

For detailed usage instructions or custom integration, please contact **[ThunderFly](https://www.thunderfly.cz/contact-us.html)**.

## Usage

The module is intended to be connected by SPI to the flight controller (FC), with the FC's firmware handling MAVLink telemetry streams. The custom LoRa packets can be transmitted to LoRaWAN networks, enhancing UAV-to-IoT capabilities. This dual-purpose use case is ideal for integrating UAV operations with broader IoT infrastructure.

## Integration with PX4

The TFLORA01 module is compatible with PX4, which manages the primary MAVLink telemetry transmissions. As the module does not include any pre-programmed firmware, users have the flexibility to implement additional features, such as periodic LoRaWAN packet transmission alongside standard telemetry streams.
