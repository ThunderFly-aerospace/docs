- **Compact Form Factor**: 50 x 50 x 8 mm with an integrated patch antenna.
- **Enhanced Performance**: Designed for weak signal environments.
- **Advanced Security**:
  - Geofencing capabilities.
  - Spoofing detection for signal integrity.
  - Message integrity protection.
- **Operational Range**:
  - Maximum altitude: 50,000 m.
  - Maximum velocity: 500 m/s.
- **Low Power**: Optimized for efficient energy use.

## Connection Details

The **TFGPSLITE02** uses the Pixhawk "Basic GPS Port" for integration with flight controllers. The port pinout is as follows:

| Pin | Signal    | Voltage |
|-----|-----------|---------|
| 1   | VCC       | +5V     |
| 2   | TX (OUT)  | +3.3V   |
| 3   | RX (IN)   | +3.3V   |
| 4   | I2C SCL   | +3.3V   |
| 5   | I2C SDA   | +3.3V   |
| 6   | GND       | GND     |

The module interfaces with the payload with the following signals:

| Pin | Signal    | Voltage |
|-----|-----------|---------|
| 1   | VCC       | +5V     |
| 2   | EXTINT (IN)  | +3.3V   |
| 3   | TPL (OUT)   | +3.3V   |
| 4   | GND       | GND     |

## Application Areas

- Lightweight UAV navigation solutions.
- Position and timing source for payloads

## Integration Guidelines

1. Connect the module to the flight controller via the Basic GPS Port.
2. Configure the UART interface for 9600 baud communication.
