| Pin | Signal    | Voltage |
|-----|-----------|---------|
| 1   | VCC       | +5V     |
| 2   | TX (OUT)  | +3.3V   |
| 3   | RX (IN)   | +3.3V   |
| 4   | I2C SCL   | +3.3V   |
| 5   | I2C SDA   | +3.3V   |
| 6   | GND       | GND     |

## Application Areas

- Lightweight UAV navigation.
- Applications requiring compact and efficient GNSS solutions.
- Environments with limited power supply.

## Integration Guidelines

1. Connect the module to the flight controller via the Basic GPS Port.
2. Configure the UART interface for 9600 baud communication.
3. For improved accuracy, enable supported augmentation systems like SBAS or QZSS.
