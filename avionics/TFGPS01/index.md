# TFGPS01 - UAV GNSS Navigation Module with RTK Capability

![TFGPS01 without enclosure](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ThunderFly-aerospace/TFGPS01/refs/heads/TFGPS01B/doc/img/TFGPS01A_top.jpg)

## Overview
The **TFGPS01** is a high-end precision GNSS navigation module designed for UAV applications. It features multi-constellation reception, high noise immunity, and RTK capability, making it suitable for various drone navigation and payload synchronization tasks. The module can operate as both a standalone UART GPS and a USB GPS receiver.

## Key Features
- **Multi-GNSS Support**: GPS, GLONASS, Galileo, and BeiDou.
- **RTK Capable**: Achieves centimeter-level accuracy with an RTK-compatible module.
- **Compatibility**: Works with PX4, Ardupilot, and other common flight stacks.
- **Integrated Safety Features**: Includes a beeper, safety LED, and an external safety switch connector.
- **Payload Interface**: Allows time synchronization and geo-fencing capabilities.
- **High Noise Immunity**: Optimized for RF-noisy environments with high-linearity and dynamic range LNA.
- **Daylight Visible LEDs**: Status indicators for power, GPS, RTK, and safety features.

## Handling Precautions
- The **TFGPS01A** is a highly sensitive device; handle it with care.
- Avoid direct contact with the antenna to prevent damage from sweat acids.

## Compatible GNSS Receiver Modules
The module is by default equipped with:
- **[uBlox NEO-9](https://www.u-blox.com/en/product/neo-m9n-module)** and a high-quality **[Taoglas](https://www.taoglas.com/product/cggp-35-3-a-02-gpsglonass-dual-band-patch-antenna-35353-5mm-2/)** patch antenna.
- It can also be equipped with **[uBlox NEO-8](https://www.u-blox.com/en/product/neo-m8p-series)** for RTK-capable GNSS receiver modes.

## High Noise Immunity
The ThunderFly **TFGPS01** GNSS receiver is optimized for operation in RF-noisy environments using a high-linearity LNA at the RF input. This results in higher power usage and slightly lower sensitivity, which can be optimized for the specific application by adjusting **R27** and **R26** resistors.

## Hardware
The **TFGPS01A** is designed as **Open-Hardware (GPL v3)**, and all documentation is available in the official repository.
