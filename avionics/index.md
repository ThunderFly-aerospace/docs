## Avionics Components

ThunderFly's avionics is a system of compact hardware devices specifically engineered to elevate today's unmanned aerial vehicle capabilities. Unlike ThunderFly's standalone instruments, these avionic components are crafted to integrate seamlessly with vehicles or technically sophisticated devices; they usually operate as part of a larger system. 

Devices cover applications from precision airspeed and temperature measurements to advanced telemetry interconnections. Key offerings include high-accuracy environmental sensors for real-time atmospheric data, onboard instruments for critical flight data collection, and solutions for flawless UAV-to-ground station communication.
